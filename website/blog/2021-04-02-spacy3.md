Recently spaCy made the change from version 2 to version 3. The update include a breaking change. Custom components are now added to a spaCy pipeline through a new syntax. 

spaCyTextBlob 3.0 is an update to align with spaCy version 3. You might notice that spaCyTextBlob is jumping from version 0.1.7 to 3.0. This is to align the versioning with spaCy in hopes that it will be more clear to users which version of spaCyTextBlob works with spaCy.

Below is a quick comparison of how the changes. Note that the key difference is after importing `SpacyTextBlob` you no longer need to create the class. When importing the custom attributes are now registered under the string "spacytextblob".

## spaCyTextBlob 3.0

Works with spaCy version 3.0 and above.

```python
>>> import spacy
>>> from spacytextblob.spacytextblob import SpacyTextBlob
>>>
>>> nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
>>> nlp.add_pipe("spacytextblob")
>>>
>>> # pipeline contains component name
>>> print(nlp.pipe_names)
['tok2vec', 'tagger', 'parser', 'ner', 'attribute_ruler', 'lemmatizer', 'spacytextblob']
>>>
>>> text = "I had a really horrible day. It was the worst day ever!" 
>>> doc = nlp(text) 
>>> print('Polarity:', doc._.polarity) 
Polarity: -1.0
>>> print('Subjectivity:', doc._.subjectivity) 
Subjectivity: 1.0
>>> print('Assessments:', doc._.assessments) 
Assessments: [(['really', 'horrible'], -1.0, 1.0, None), (['worst', '!'], -1.0, 1.0, None)]  
```

## spaCyTextBlob 0.1.7

Works with spaCy 2.*.

```python
>>> import spacy
>>> from spacytextblob.spacytextblob import SpacyTextBlob
>>>
>>> nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
>>> spacy_text_blob = SpacyTextBlob()
>>>
>>> # pipeline contains component name
>>> nlp.add_pipe(spacy_text_blob)
>>> print(nlp.pipe_names)
['tagger', 'parser', 'ner', 'text_blob_sentiment']
>>>
>>> text = "I had a really horrible day. It was the worst day ever!" 
>>> doc = nlp(text) 
>>> print('Polarity:', doc._.polarity) 
Polarity: -1.0
>>> print('Subjectivity:', doc._.subjectivity) 
Subjectivity: 1.0
>>> print('Assessments:', doc._.assessments) 
Assessments: [(['really', 'horrible'], -1.0, 1.0, None), (['worst', '!'], -1.0, 1.0, None)]  
```
